# START Hack 2024 | St. Gallen

GitHub repository for our project for the START Hack 2024 hackathon in St. Gallen taking place from 20.03.2024 to 22.03.2024.

## Syngenta Group Case

Using satellite imagery, weather and other datasets from real farms, build a gamified solution to illustrate the impact of different farm decisions (such as what crop to plant, wether to till the soil, how much fertilizer to apply) on agricultural and sustainability outcomes.

The solution can take various forms: an app, *website*, or online game etc.
